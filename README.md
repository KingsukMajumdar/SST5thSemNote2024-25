This course is designed to enhance participants' proficiency in English, focusing on
pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, listening, comprehension, and fluent speaking. Through
interactive sessions, group activities, and individual tasks, learners will develop the
necessary language skills for effective communication in academic and professional
settings.

I have taken help from Google and AI for formatting, and other sites for IEEE standards.
